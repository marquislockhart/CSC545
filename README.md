# Art Gallery
A project for the course CSC 545: Advanced Database Systems. The premise of the project is to use multiple database structures to create a functioning website, and then compare the usage and implementation of the databases.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, Apache is required to connect to a localhost. PHPmyAdmin and MongoDB are also required to import the necessary databases for the application.

## Running the tests
### mySQL
1. Start up the xampp control panel.

2. Turn on Apache and mySQL.

3. In phpMyAdmin, import the 'artgallery.sql' database.

4. Create a project folder in 'C:>xampp>htdocs' containing all files from the repository.

5. Connect to the localhost in a browser of your choice and navigate the .php files.

### MongoDB
1. Start up the xampp control panel.

2. Run the following command ```mongod```

3. Connect to your MongoDB server.

4. Run the following command ```mongo```.

5. Import the MongoDB database.

## Built With
Apache - web server used to run the website on a localhost.

PHP mySQL - used to develop the RDBMS.

MongoDB - used as a document database to compare to the RDBMS.

## Versioning
The current version of this project is v1.0.

## Authors
Marquis Lockhart - Database to front-end implementation.

Erika Mazurkiewicz - MongoDB front-end implementation.

Greg Rodriguez - Database structure & organization.
